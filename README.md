# apixu-api-weather-app

### 9.28.2019 update
Apixu has now merged with WeatherStack and the API is now named as such. Endpoints and CSS styles have been updated to work with this API update, but the all of the forecast data that Apixu offered for free is now paid-only data. 
The new version of this web app now has very little information compared to its previous version.
This project will now be abandoned and no future updates will be made. Hoping to find a different weather API in the future that provides more data as Apixu once did and will start a new project at some point.
